Title: Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding: A method for visualizing high dimensional datasets
Version: 0.2.2
Author: Yan Wu
Maintainer: Yan Wu <yauwning@gmail.com>
Description: Uses NMF to reduce high dimenensional dataset into NMF components, embeds NMF components
  in a 2D space for visualization, and then embeds the data points based on their NMF component magnitudes,
  using a similarity matrix to ensure that data points close in the high dimensional space are also close 
  in the 2D visualization. Because the NMFs are embedded in the visualization as well,
  they can be interpreted via correlation with the features in the dataset.
